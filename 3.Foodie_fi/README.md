The plain sql scripts for all queries are located [here]()


### Introduction


Foodie-Fi is a subscription-based and food-related streaming service, akin to Netflix but focused solely on cooking shows. 

During sign-up, there are two subscription plans for customers to choose from:

- Basic: $9.90 monthly, provides limited access to streaming videos.
- Pro: $19.90 monthly or $199 annually, offers unlimited watch time and the ability to download videos for offline viewing.

Customers can opt for a 7-day free trial which will automatically continue to the Pro monthly subscription plan unless they cancel, downgrade to Basic, or upgrade to an annual Pro plan.
